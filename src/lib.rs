//! # ArgoFlows
//!
//! `argoflows` is a Rust crate designed for seamless interaction with Argo Workflows within Kubernetes environments.
//! It provides a robust API for managing workflows programmatically, facilitating automation and operational efficiency.
//!
//! ## Features
//! - Create, delete, and manage Argo workflows programmatically
//! - Retrieve real-time workflow statuses
//! - Trigger and monitor workflow executions
//!
//! ## Installation
//! To integrate `argoflows` into your project, add the following dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! argoflows = "0.1"
//! ```
//!
//! ## Usage Example
//! Below is a basic example demonstrating how to list workflows using `argoflows`:
//! ```rust
//! use argoflows::client::ArgoClient;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let client = ArgoClient::new("https://argo-server.example.com");
//!     match client.list_workflows() {
//!         Ok(workflows) => println!("Workflows retrieved: {}", workflows.len()),
//!         Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to fetch workflows: {}", e),
//!     }
//! }
//! ```
